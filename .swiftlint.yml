- convenience_type #Avoid instantiation by using a caseless enum for hosting only static members.
- empty_count #This rule can potentially improve performance, especially with iterating over large collections.
- empty_string #Avoiding instantiation of an empty String by using isEmpty over "".
- fatal_error_message #A fatalError is often used to prevent invalid states and to help you debug your code. A fatalError is most likely easier to understand by enforcing a message within the body.
- first_where #Performance is improved by using .first(where:) over .filter { }.first in collections to prevent iterating over the whole collection.
- modifier_order #Consistency throughout your project improves readability overall. This rule enforces the order of modifiers by requiring override before public, public before final and so on.
- toggle_bool #Prefer someBool.toggle() over someBool = !someBool.
- unused_private_declaration #It is important to keep your codebase clean. This rule prevents unused private declarations and allows you to remove unused code.
- unavailable_function #Unimplemented functions should be marked as unavailable.
